Springrole has a newsfeed page - similar it to Facebook posts or LinkedIn Posts - where a User can create a message Post. Others can Comment on the post. The skeleton models are provided above.

The application will fetch posts from the newsfeed_controller. Presume that there are hundreds of posts per day. There may be a web app or mobile app or 3rd party consumer.

Build out the newsfeed_controllerso that someone can fetch newsfeeds and produce the JSON above. You can presume that you only fetch 50 at a time.

You do not have to have this be a running Rails app, but please use real code in your example (not pseudo code).

Some considerations that we want you to work on:
Can you make the queries efficient (what would this mean)?
What if we want to reuse the query in other tasks? Would you organize the code in a different way? (e.g. Email the most recent 50 posts to somebody).

NOTE: Please DO NOT put your code in a public domain. Send it back to us via email in a zip file.
